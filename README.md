Welcome to the read me where you will look at the pretty words of an album and its title!

A few things before things get running, this is created in Visual Studio 2019 and a few items may be needed.

Assumptions: 
The person running the code knows how to install the following:
1. NuGet Package Manager from Visual Studio extentions
2. Newtonsoft.Json from the Nuget Package Manager
The user has cloned the repository.

After everything is installed, open up Visual Studio and open a Project/Solution open the "AlbumPickerConsole.sln" -> navigate to "Program.cs" -> Run the application by clicking the play button or hit F5 while the code. A few
prompts will show up and will ask you a few questions which is about the app.

If the console app needs an executable just email me at jesselua5@gmail.com and I will publish the solution.


Notes about the code: 
1. ContinueQuestion() could be changed to if statement but it made it so there had to be 2 inputs to continue, chose switch for a "quick fix".
2. Would be optimal if the person "accidently" opened the app and did not know how to exit, and that would mean needing a quit option right from the first prompt.
